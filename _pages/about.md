Hi I'm Morris John Montemayor. An aspiring Software Engineer.

I recently graduated at Polytechnic University of the Philippines with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering. I have cultivated my skills through various school works and personal projects and am currently looking for a team where I can contribute my passion and expertise.

I like building things! I find it really fun when I see my ideas come to life.

When I'm not programming I like to create wood working projects and do physical activities.
